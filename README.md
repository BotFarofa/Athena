# Athena

Athena is a utility which generates the current Fortnite Item Shop into a stylized image and shares it on Twitter.

## Requirements

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/)
- [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#basic-installation)

An [fnbr.co API Key](https://fnbr.co/api/docs) is required to obtain the Item Shop data, [Twitter API credentials](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) are required to Tweet the image.

## Usage

Open `configuration_example.json` in your preferred text editor, fill the configurable values. Once finished, save and rename the file to `configuration.json`.

- `delayStart`: Set to `0` to begin the process immediately
- `supportACreator`: Leave blank to omit the Support-A-Creator tag section of the Tweet
- `twitter`: Set `enabled` to `false` if you wish for `itemshop.png` to not be Tweeted

Edit the images found in `assets/images/` to your liking, avoid changing image dimensions for optimal results.
